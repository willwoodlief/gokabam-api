=== GoKabam Api  ===
 This is software to develop an api I am working on.


 I had issues finding development software for api/database/user flow work so I am making my own.
 its a hassel, really. But I think I will save time in the long run. Because this will optimize my work and since I am the only person working on this, I can make it match how my mind works lol



 I want to get this functional enough to where I can start entering data and working on the real api, while I am still working on this too
